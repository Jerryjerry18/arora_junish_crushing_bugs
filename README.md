# leaning More in js and exicted with these assignments 
In this assignment we have two bugs which includes one container should not include more then one image  secondly when we change the background image it should remove all the images on the board to disappear and user has to refresh it because the four puzzle images are not related to other changing background boards 


breifly we only have green puzzle borads but we dont have another puzzle pieces which are going to be similar with the background colours so the images should be removed and then after refreshing should apepear more relavent . also one image shoulld not fit on top of another images is also fixed
